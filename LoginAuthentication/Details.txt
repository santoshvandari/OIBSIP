Project: Basic Login Authentication System



1. Project Overview:

   Create a simple login authentication system using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.) that allows users to register, login, and access a secured page.



2. Requirements:

   - The system should have a user registration feature where users can sign up by providing a username and password.

   - The system should store user information securely (avoid storing plain text passwords).

   - The system should have a login feature where users can enter their credentials to access the secured page.

   - The secured page should only be accessible to logged-in users.



3. Tools and Technologies:

   - Choose a programming language and any necessary frameworks or libraries for the implementation.

   - For beginners, using simple data structures like dictionaries or arrays to store user information might be a good option.



4. Implementation Steps:

   Here's a general outline of how to approach the implementation:



   a. User Registration:

      - Create a function or module to handle user registration.

      - Prompt the user to enter a username and password.

      - Store the user information securely in a data structure (e.g., dictionary, array).



   b. Password Encryption:

      - Use cryptographic libraries (e.g., bcrypt, hashlib) to hash and salt the user's password before storing it.

      - Avoid storing plain text passwords to enhance security.



   c. User Login:

      - Create a function or module to handle user login.

      - Prompt the user to enter their username and password.

      - Compare the entered password with the stored hashed password to verify the login.



   d. Secured Page:

      - Implement a basic secured page that displays a simple message or content to authenticated users only.



5. Error Handling:

   - Implement proper error handling to handle cases like incorrect login credentials, already registered users, etc.



6. Testing:

   - Test the system thoroughly to ensure it works as expected, covering both positive and negative scenarios.
